= midi-jruby

== Summary

Simple MIDI wrapper for realtime IO in JRuby. Uses javax.sound.midi.

In the interest of allowing people on other platforms to utilize your code, you should consider using {unimidi}[http://github.com/arirusso/unimidi].  Unimidi is a platform independent wrapper which implements midi-jruby for users who are using jruby.  

== Features

* Input and output on multiple devices concurrently
* Agnostically handle different MIDI Message types (including SysEx)
* Timestamped input events

== Install

* gem install midi-jruby

== Usage 

This library requires that JRuby be run in '1.9 mode'.  This is normally done by passing --1.9 to JRuby at the command line
	
== Examples

* {input}[http://github.com/arirusso/midi-jruby/blob/master/examples/input.rb]
* {output}[http://github.com/arirusso/midi-jruby/blob/master/examples/output.rb]
